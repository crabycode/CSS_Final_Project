Craby's First Personal Website
<br>
This is my final project after the CSS course. It is my first ever personal website(portofolio). I tried to demonstrate everything 
I learned from the course and also did some research on websites (mostly w3schools) to enhance my knowledge! Key things that 
I learned apart from the codedex course and would like to mention is adding some "responsiveness" to my website.

<ul>
<li>Using the :hover to an element so it changes when you hover it with your mouse</li>
<li>Using scroll-behaviour to make the website smoother</li>
  </ul>
<br>You can check my demo project out through this link:<br>

<br>All images are in a local folder, so if you want to open the website and code on your machine, you need to download the whole ZIP from my github.<br>
Here is my github repo:<br>

P.S. The only thing that I'm not sure about is weather the discord link in the "connect" tab is working.
